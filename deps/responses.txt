***NO_MOVIES***
I didn't quite catch a movie in that response.
I'm only interested in talking about movies right now - sorry.
Hey, how about we talk about movies, instead?
Pal, I kinda wanna talk about movies.
Let's talk about movies.
UUuuhh soooooooo wanna talk about movies?
If we could stick to movies?
My dumb chatbot brain can't really handle non-movie related things for the most part.
Could we stick to talking about movies?
Can we stick to talking about movies please?
If we could stick to talking about movies...
Hate to segue, but can we talk about movies?
Any chance we could talk about movies?
Yo, could we tlak about movies? Oh whoops, I meant *talk. My bad.
I'd love to hear about a movie you've seen!
Tbh, I want to chat about movies!
That sentence didn't make much sense - sorry :(
***WRONG_QUOTES***
I'm not sure I understand - make sure you're only telling me about one movie at a time.
Hey man, can you tell me about one movie at a time?
Hey pal, can we talk about exactly one movie?
Sorry, I don't follow - one movie at a time please.
I didn't quite catch that.
I'm not sure if I saw a movie there.
Theres way too much for me to handle there. Wanna help me out and form that sentence properly?
Sooooo, I dont think I can handle what you've given me there. Actually let me give it a try. Nope. Didn't work. Try again?

Sorry, I have no idea whether you liked REPL or not. Please forgive my dumb robot brain.
I have zero idea as to whether you liked REPL.

***REC_QUESTION***
Would you like another suggestion?
Hey, do you want another recommendation? I promise it will be good!
Can I give you one more?
Please, let me give you one more recommendation?

Want another rec?
Do you want me to suggest another one?
Want another one?
I can suggest something else too if you'd like?
***READY_TO_REC***
I've got it!
Let me think a bit! Ooo, I think I got the perfect one for you!
With the power of my big data, I shall give you the perfect recommendation!
I've got an idea.
I have a fantastic recommendation for you, dude!
I think I have enough information.
Hmmm.
My neural network just had an insight!
My mighty AI has had an insight!
Hmm, let me ask my *insert AI buzzword* system for the best recommendation. Be back in a sec!
This one is one of my personal favorites.
I just machine learnt a bunch and can give you a fantastic recommendation.
Alright. Let me think about this. How about... wait no. That was a bad idea. Maybe... No Not that either. Ooooh what about... No, I just like that because I'm software. Oh I know!
I think I've got it.
Think I have an idea of what you might like.
Alright, no promises, but I think I know what you might like.
Based on the simple-item-item cosine distances of the items you like, I think I can recommend something.
I wish I had a bunch of extra data about you, but I think I can make a recommendation like this.
Alrighty then, I can recommend you something. Hopefully I don't crash during this.
***GOODBYE_GAVE_REC***

***DISAMB***
I see REPL movies with the name REP2. Which one were you referring to?
There are REPL movies like REP2 - can you be more specific?
Please clarify which of the REPL REP2 movies you were referring to?
***ANGER***
I sense some anger there.
I'm feeling like your a little angry. Sorry about that.
I can feel that you're angry? Sorry about that, pal.
Whoa, don't get angry - we're all friends here.
So. Not super useful given the way you feel, but theres an Adam Sandler movie called Anger Management, that you you might like rn since you seem angry. Or, or not. Its Adam Sandler.
Ooooh anger. Can I try this one? GRRRRRRRRR. Did I do it right?
***ANTICIPATION***
Well aren't you just ready to pop.
I'm sensing some anticipation! Glad you're excited.
Aren't you just so excited? Well, I certainly am!
***JOY***
Its good to see that you're doing well.
Glad to see your happy :)
Yay, I am so happy too! Glad you are feeling upbeat!
I love when my friends are happy!
***TRUST***
Calm and collected - I like that.
***FEAR***
I'm sorry your worried :(
My dear friend, I am here for you. Fear no more please.
Don't be scared - I'm here!
I wish I could help you with that fear, but unfortunately I lack a physical form.
Do not be afraid. Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate and hate leads to suffering.
***SURPRISE***
That is shocking!
What a shock? Is this real?
Man, I'm surprised too!
That's really surprising!
What a surprising turn of events!
I can't really believe it either!
Wow. I just dont know what to say. Thats just so... wow.
***SADNESS***
Now I'm sad too.
Aw, I'm sad that you are sad. Let's not be sad.
Aw, I'm sorry you're feeling sad.
Hey, I am sorry to hear you are sad. I am here for you.
***DISGUST***
Oh, gross!
Gross. Just gross.
TMI.
So gross. Why would you tell me that?
I'm so glad they didn't program with the ability to vomit.
Yuck, that's disgusting.
That's absolutely disgusting.
Hmm, that's definitely very gross!

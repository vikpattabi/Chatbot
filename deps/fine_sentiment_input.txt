I thought "Heat (1995)" was a horrible film.
I didn't like "Aliens (1986)"
I had a really really awful time watching "Broken Arrow (1996)"
I really loved Judge Dredd (1995)
"Hackers (1995)" started out mediocre but by the end it was totally great and I absolutely loved it.
"Aliens (1986)" was a very thrilling movie!

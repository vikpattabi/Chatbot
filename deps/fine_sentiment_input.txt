I thought "Heat (1995)" was a horrible film.
I hated "Nixon (1995)"
I had a really awful time watching "Broken Arrow (1996)"
I really didn't love Judge Dredd (1995)
:quit
"Hackers (1995)" started out mediocre but by the end it was totally great and I loved it.
"Aliens (1986)" was a thrilling movie!
